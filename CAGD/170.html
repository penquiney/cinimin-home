		<p>Crab Coat Solitaire is a heavy modification solitaire in shape and procedure. This form of solitaire shifts the objective from the straightforward solution of uncovering all cards and moving them to the 4 stacks of suits, to alignment of card stacks in a grid. The goal is to create a pattern of black and red, with each pattern having a unique name and difficulty.</p>
		<img src="../images/CAGD/board.png" style="width: 50%;">
		<p>The player can then move revealed cards of adjacent value onto each other. This is the basic game play procedure the player undergoes for most of the game. As the player reduces the number of stacks and unrevealed cards they should keep in mind that they need to form a pattern. If the player ends up with a set of top cards that cannot be moved, then they have lost.</p>
		<p>Some significant modifications to the game since the last post came once again in the difficulty department. The distribution diagram is no longer really necessary as the distribution is even across the 3 by 3 square with 4 cards in each pile. This leaves 16 cards left over to be the reintroduction of the Stock and Waste piles from regular solitaire. </p>
		<p>This solution came from play testing and getting a feel for what players liked about the game. The game seemed to have a learning curve but it was rewarding to learn how to play. The flexibility of the game seemed to spark interest and the addition of this new feature would allow greater ease and simpler setup. I'm a little concerned that this might make the game too easy but this can be changed later with more play testing very easily by taking cards from the stock and adding them back to the board. (Realizing right now that I should probably make a diagram of the way the game is setup with actual labels.)</p>
		<p>Changes to the wording of the rule sheet were made to help clarify things that were confusing to play testers. I should continue this process and a couple of the rule sheets that I play tested personally impressed me with how concise and well defined they were. I might be hindered by the novelty of this game in comparison to the more familiar vanilla solitaire but there's absolutely more improvements to be made. Players definitely were skimming over the rule sheet so I also added some underlines to hopefully catch their eye with some of the most important stuff.</p>
		<p>The play-testing experience was extremely valuable and I learned a lot about what changes I want to try and where to improve the game. Before the play test I was pretty unsure but seeing how other players responded to the game helped a ton.</p>
		<p>Reviews of the rule sheet itself indicated that they found the patterns gimmick fun but this does contradict a seeming disinterest in the patterns from play testing. I was previously doubting if they should be included at all, but they are ultimately not a huge influence on game play as long as the patterns are plentiful.</p>

		<h3>Crab Coat Solitaire v.1</h3>

		<p>Crab Coat Solitaire is a heavy modification solitaire in shape and procedure. This form of solitaire shifts the objective from the straightforward solution of uncovering all cards and moving them to the 4 stacks of suits, to alignment of card stacks in a grid. The goal is to create a pattern of black and red, with each pattern having a unique name and difficulty.</p>
		<img src="../images/CAGD/board.png" style="width: 50%;">
		<p>The player can then move revealed cards of adjacent value onto each other. This is the basic game play procedure the player undergoes for most of the game. As the player reduces the number of stacks and unrevealed cards they should keep in mind that they need to form a pattern. If the player ends up with a set of top cards that cannot be moved, then they have lost.</p>
		<p>This is where the initial and continuing bump in development came as the distribution of all 52 cards in a 3x3 grid can drastically affect difficulty. The first distribution I tried was:</p>
		<p>5    5    5<br>7    8    7<br>5    5    5</p>
		<p>After some testing this proved to be too difficult and two possible solutions were formed. Either change the initial layout to something that's not square, such as extending the sides but not the corners, or moving more cards from the top and bottom rows to the center. Both went through some play testing and were successful at reducing the difficulty of getting a basic patter completed. The 3 x 3 square is much easier to setup and explain than a non square shape and there were also mechanics in place that were centered around the square shape and the possibility of a player clearing out a row or a diagonal. To keep the game more straightforward it was determined that the 3x3 grid would be changed to this distribution:</p>
		<p>4 4 4<br>8 9 8<br>4 4 4</p>
		<p>This makes basic 2x3 patterns much easier to accomplish but also makes harder patterns that rely on even fewer stacks much harder.</p>
		<p>The game still feels pretty hard and while this can be rewarding I'm interested in finding some more ways to lower the barrier to entry. I play a lot of solitaire on bus rides so I'm somewhat used to this specific kind of challenge. Finding a player that does not typically play solitaire games would be helpful at gauging what the barrier to entry really is. </p>
		<p>Currently play testing is a slow process without a partner and I should be getting friends to try it out more often. Though not many of them are probably all that interested in solitaire. </p>
		<p>A generally inconsequential part of developing the rule sheets was writing names for the different patterns. For now any more revision of names should be put on the back burner since it doesn't affect the quality of the game play. Increasing the variety of patterns would be a more worthwhile effort and the number of options for each number of stacks could change the difficulty a lot. I don't want to make the patterns totally harmless by creating a bunch of patterns that count as a win but I also don't want a player that manages to get a 1x3 array of stacks to be unable to count this achievement as a win because I only designated a couple patterns as win conditions.</p>
